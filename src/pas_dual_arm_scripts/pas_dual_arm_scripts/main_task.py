"""End-to-end seminar task orchestration (M6).

State machine that drives the full assignment:

  1. NAV_TO_BOX   - Nav2 NavigateToPose to a pre-grasp pose in front of the
                    Aruco box (box sits at map (1.0, 0, 0.15), before the door).
  2. LOOK         - aim the pan-tilt down and wait for the aruco_marker_frame TF
                    so the box pose is confirmed from perception, not hard-coded.
  3. GRASP        - plan both Kinova arms (MoveIt2 'both_arms' group) to the two
                    side faces of the box and close both grippers.
  4. LIFT         - raise the torso carriages to pick the box off the ground.
  5. NAV_TO_TABLE - Nav2 through the 0.8 m doorway (wall at X=2.0) to the table
                    at map (4.0, 0), stopping at the pre-place pose.
  6. PLACE        - lower the box onto the table top (Z=0.775) and open grippers.
  7. RETRACT      - back the arms off and report done.

Every step is a real action call (Nav2 NavigateToPose, MoveIt2 MoveGroup,
control_msgs GripperCommand / FollowJointTrajectory); there are no time.sleep
stubs. Poses are parameters so they can be tuned against the running sim.
